876. Middle of the Linked List

Easy

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

Example 1:

    1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

    Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
    Output: [3,4,5]
    Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.

Example 2:

    1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6

    Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    Output: [4,5,6]
    Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.

Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
    1 <= Node.val <= 100

3467. Transform Array by Parity

Easy

Hint

You are given an integer array nums. Transform nums by performing the following operations in the exact order specified:

    Replace each even number with 0.
    Replace each odd numbers with 1.
    Sort the modified array in non-decreasing order.

Return the resulting array after performing these operations.

        Example 1:

        Input: nums = [4,3,2,1]

        Output: [0,0,1,1]

        Explanation:

            Replace the even numbers (4 and 2) with 0 and the odd numbers (3 and 1) with 1. Now, nums = [0, 1, 0, 1].
            After sorting nums in non-descending order, nums = [0, 0, 1, 1].

        Example 2:

        Input: nums = [1,5,1,4,2]

        Output: [0,0,1,1,1]

        Explanation:

            Replace the even numbers (4 and 2) with 0 and the odd numbers (1, 5 and 1) with 1. Now, nums = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0].
            After sorting nums in non-descending order, nums = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1].

Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 100
    1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
